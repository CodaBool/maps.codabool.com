# Maps in CyberSpace
This is a foundry first compendium. It showcases a preview of all the maps available in the module. However, a collection of the images can still be downloaded from <a href="http://gurpsland.no-ip.org/geomorphs/">Eric Smith's</a> website. Or for individual images they can be found within the public folder of this repo.

### Compression
all images have already been compressed with `pngcrush`. There is no optimization needed.

# Dev notes
